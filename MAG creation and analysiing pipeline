Create prokaryotic MAGs from metagenomes
With Virsorter2 recognise viral sequences from a conting inside a bin/MAG
Check with CheckV the quality of the sequences from fasta files
Find genes and predict proteins with Prodigal from fasta files
Annotate found proteins with Hmmer3 with imgvr and/or pvog databases (for viral proteins) and KEGG database (for prokaryotic proteins)

To identify MAGs correctly, each MAG must have unique_name = subject_ID+MAG_ID

For data visualisation use R. The following tolls were installed in supercomputer, and access via terminal Cygwin64 Terminal: Virsorter2, CheckV, Prodigal, Hmmer3.
