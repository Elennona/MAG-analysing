To run Hmmer3 you will need database presented as a hmm profile. 

1) download the database you need. I used PVOG, KEGG and IMGVR databases
2) Unzip if needed
3) cd to folder containing the database
4) catalogue all files into one file (cat *.hmm >> database_name_all.hmms)
5) activate hmmer3 environment
6) hmmpress database_name_all.hmms
